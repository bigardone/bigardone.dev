Thanks to our personal experience working on legacy **Rails** applications, we've been
able to see several different approaches on how other developers usually organize
**JavaScript** assets.
Choosing the wrong approach, or not even having one, will give you some headaches
in the future â€“ in other words, just requiring everything in your manifest file (`application.js`) and relying on multiple document load handlers across serveral files with the hope that everything will just work fine is not a good idea.
For our last projects (both client and internal ones) we've been replacing the **Asset Pipeline**
with **Webpack** to handle asset files requirement and build process, loving the result so far.
That's why the first time I took a look at **Phoenix**'s documentation and discovered
that there was not such a thing as the [Asset Pipeline][55ded47a] I got instantly hooked by it.

## Simple approach using Brunch and ES6

In order to build assets, **Phoenix** initially comes with [Brunch][6ee6be5c] out of the box, and
not only that, it also comes configured to support **ES6** by default, including
its modules syntax. Taking advantage of this, let's generate a very basic project and
see how we can create a better way of organizing the JavaScript instead of putting
everything we might need in `app.js` as if it was a **Rails** project.

### Generating the project

Let's begin by installing the lates version on **Phoenix**:

```
$ mix archive.install https://github.com/phoenixframework/archives/raw/master/phoenix_new.ez && mix local.phoenix

Found existing archive(s): phoenix_new.ez.
Are you sure you want to replace them? [Yn]
* creating /Users/myuser/.mix/archives/phoenix_new.ez
Found existing archive(s): phoenix_new.ez.
Are you sure you want to replace them? [Yn]
* creating /Users/myuser/.mix/archives/phoenix_new.ez
```

Now that we are up to date, let's generate a new **Phoenix** project:

```
$ mix phoenix.new phoenix_template

* creating phoenix_template/config/config.exs
* creating phoenix_template/config/dev.exs
* creating phoenix_template/config/prod.exs
* creating phoenix_template/config/prod.secret.exs
* ...
* ...

We are all set! Run your Phoenix application:

    $ cd phoenix_template
    $ mix phoenix.server

You can also run your app inside IEx (Interactive Elixir) as:

    $ iex -S mix phoenix.server

Before moving on, configure your database in config/dev.exs and run:

    $ mix ecto.create
```

After following the instructions and running the server we can see that the new
application is ready.

### Shared common JavaScript between views

Before continuing let's first think about what our good old web application is going
to need. There's probably going to be some common js functionality shared across
the whole application, like handling pulldown menus in the header, initialazing
third party plugins, etc. Having this in mind we can create our first js module
that will be in charge of all this common functionality that needs to be executed
on every page:

```javascript
// web/static/js/views/main.js

export default class MainView {
  mount() {
    // This will be executed when the document loads...
    console.log('MainView mounted');
  }

  unmount() {
    // This will be executed when the document unloads...
    console.log('MainView unmounted');
  }
}
```

The `MainView` module will basically have to main functions:

  - **mount** which will be called every time the page loads and will contain all the initializing of common functionality needed.
  - **umount** which can be used to add any functionality needed to be executed when the document unloads. This might be useful in some situations like showing a confirm alert to the user when he tries to leave an edit view with unsaved changes, for example.

Now let's update the main `app.js` file so it uses the new `MainView` module:

```javascript
// web/static/js/app.js

import 'phoenix_html';
import MainView from './views/main';

function handleDOMContentLoaded() {
  const view = new MainView();
  view.mount();

  window.currentView = view;
}

function handleDocumentUnload() {
  window.currentView.unmount();
}

window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', handleDOMContentLoaded, false);
window.addEventListener('unload', handleDocumentUnload, false);
```

We add an event listener so when the `DOM` is completely loaded it initialzes the
`MainView`, *mounts* it and assigns it globally. We are also doing the same for the
`unload` event of the document. If we now open the web inspector, we can see the log
message and verify everything that is working fine:

<img src="/images/blog/page-specific-javascript-phoenix/template-2.jpg">


We can see the log message, yay! Let's add one more route so we can navigate
through both the root and the new one and check what happens:

```elixir
# web/router.ex

defmodule PhoenixTemplate.Router do
  use PhoenixTemplate.Web, :router

  # ...
  # ...

  scope "/", PhoenixTemplate do
    pipe_through :browser # Use the default browser stack

    get "/", PageController, :index
    get "/new", PageController, :new
  end
end
```

We need to add the new action to the existing controller:

```elixir
# web/controllers/page_controller.ex

defmodule PhoenixTemplate.PageController do
  use PhoenixTemplate.Web, :controller

  # ...

  def new(conn, _params) do
    render conn, "new.html"
  end
end
```

Next step is to create the new template and update the existing `index` one, so
they display the current view module  and template:

```elixir
<!-- web/templates/page/index.html.eex -->
<!-- web/templates/page/new.html.eex -->

<div class="jumbotron">
  <h2><%= @view_module  %></h2>
  <p class="lead"><%= @view_template %></p></p>
</div>
```

Finally we have to update the main layout template with the navigation links:

```elixir
<!-- web/templates/layout/app.html.eex -->

...
...

<body>
    <div class="container">
      <header class="header">
        <nav role="navigation">
          <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
            <li><%= link("Index", to: page_path(@conn, :index)) %></li>
            <li><%= link("New", to: page_path(@conn, :new)) %></li>
          </ul>
...
...
```

Now we can click in the new link and check that it works just the same as before:

From now on, every time we create a new route and it's view/template is shown to the
user, all the common **JavaScript** functionality will be executed exactly the same
as in any other route. But what happens I if we want to add some unique behaviour to a
specific view/template?

### View/tempate specific JavaScript

The main idea is to specify somehow in the `app.js` the **JavaScript** view we want to mount
instead of the `MainView`, but executing all the common stuff as well. To do so we are
going to create a helper function to generate the current view/template name which we'll
use later to mount it. Let's add it to the `LayoutView` module:

```ruby
# web/views/layout_view.ex

defmodule PhoenixTemplate.LayoutView do
  use PhoenixTemplate.Web, :view

  @doc """
  Generates name for the JavaScript view we want to use
  in this combination of view/template.
  """
  def js_view_name(conn, view_template) do
    [view_name(conn), template_name(view_template)]
    |> Enum.reverse
    |> List.insert_at(0, "view")
    |> Enum.map(&String.capitalize/1)
    |> Enum.reverse
    |> Enum.join("")
  end

  # Takes the resource name of the view module and removes the
  # the ending *_view* string.
  defp view_name(conn) do
    conn
    |> view_module
    |> Phoenix.Naming.resource_name
    |> String.replace("_view", "")
  end

  # Removes the extion from the template and reutrns
  # just the name.
  defp template_name(template) when is_binary(template) do
    template
    |> String.split(".")
    |> Enum.at(0)
  end
end
```

The result for the *Elixir.PhoenixTemplate.PageView* view and *index.html* template
will be `PageIndexView`, and on the other hand, for the **new.html** template will
be `PageNewView`. Now we need a place to set the returning name so that it's accessible
to the **JavaScript**, so let's add it as a `data` attribute to the body tag:

```elixir
<!-- web/templates/layout/app.html.eex -->

...
...

<body data-js-view-name="<%= js_view_name(@conn, @view_template) %>">

...
```

After refreshing the browser and inspecting the source code it should look something like this:

```html
<body data-js-view-name="PageIndexView">
```

All right! So let's create a specific **JavaScript** view for the **new.html** template:

```javascript
// web/static/js/views/page/new.js

import MainView from '../main';

export default class View extends MainView {
  mount() {
    super.mount();

    // Specific logic here
    console.log('PageNewView mounted');
  }

  unmount() {
    super.unmount();

    // Specific logic here
    console.log('PageNewView unmounted');
  }
}
```

Note how `View` extends `MainView` and how we are calling its super functions in both
`mount()` and `mount()`. This way it will run all the common functionality like in any
other view/template before running any specifc logic. Now we need a mechanism to
load the current view name module so we can call its `mount` and `unmount` methods, so
let's write a simple loader module:

```javascript
// web/static/js/views/loader.js

import MainView    from './main';
import PageNewView from './page/new';

// Collection of specific view modules
const views = {
  PageNewView,
};

export default function loadView(viewName) {
  return views[viewName] || MainView;
}
```

We need to import any specific page view we need to have and add it to the `views` object.
The `loadView` function will try to return it by its `viewName` argument, returning the
`MainView` if not found. Finally we need to change the code in the `app.js` file in order
to use the `loadView` function:

```javascript
// web/static/js/app.js

import 'phoenix_html';
import loadView from './views/loader';

function handleDOMContentLoaded() {
  // Get the current view name
  const viewName = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].dataset.jsViewName;

  // Load view class and mount it
  const ViewClass = loadView(viewName);
  const view = new ViewClass();
  view.mount();

  window.currentView = view;
}

function handleDocumentUnload() {
  window.currentView.unmount();
}

window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', handleDOMContentLoaded, false);
window.addEventListener('unload', handleDocumentUnload, false);
```

Note the subtle change in the `handleDOMContentLoaded`. It gets the `viewName` from
the body's data attribute previously set by the `js_view_name/2` function. Then it
uses the `loadView` function to get the view class by `viewName` and creates a new
view object with it and calling its `mount` method. And with this, we are done!
If we inspect the browser's console it should look somehting like this:

<img src="/images/blog/page-specific-javascript-phoenix/template-4.jpg">


We can now see the 2 log messages resulting from calling the `mount` function of
the `view` object which is a `PageNewView`. One message for the `super.mount()` call and
the second one of its own.

### Conclusion

Thanks to this small changes we can organize the **JavaScript** of a fresh new
generated **Phoenix** project in a more tiddy and efficient way, without the need
of any other third party libraries, appart from those which are initially added.
Of course there can be several different ways of achieving something similar, like
removing **Brunch** and using **Webpack** and it's dynamic module loading, which we
will comment on the next post. Meanwhile, don't forget to check out the source code:
