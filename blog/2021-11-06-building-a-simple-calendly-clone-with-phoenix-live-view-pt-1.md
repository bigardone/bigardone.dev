## Motivation
I've been using **Elixir** and **Phoenix** for the last six years to build from APIs to complete web applications using **React** and **Elm** on the front-end, being **Elm** my weapon of choice primarily. Since **LiveView** came out, I have played around with it a couple of times, first to build an [ant farm] and second to set up a [headless CMS]. However, I never ended up getting hooked by it, and I kept relying on **Elm** to build my front-ends. But when **Phoenix v1.6** and **LiveView v0.17** came out, my feelings about **LiveView** changed utterly, and I couldn't resist making something more extensive to test out all its new features, making me finally understand all of its power.

## Why Calendly?
When I want to dive deep into new technology, I like building a small clone of a popular service to see how far I can get with it. Scheduling services like [Calendly] have become very popular, and often people share their public calendar links so others can select the ideal date and time for a meeting. Therefore, after examining its UI, I thought it would be a fun pet project and an excellent tutorial to share.

## What are we going to build?
Since **Calendly** has tons of features, and this tutorial is about **Phoenix LiveView**, we will focus on its core, which is managing even types and scheduling events. Our application will consist of two different parts:

1. The sharable public page where invitees can select an event type, a date, and a slot to schedule a meeting with us.
2. The private admin site, protected by Basic HTTP authentication, where we can create and edit event types and manage all the scheduled events.

Regarding **LiveView**, we are going to rely on some of its more powerful features such as:

- Live sessions.
- Live components.
- Function components.
- JS hooks.
- JS commands.

Here are some screenshots of the final result:

### The home page.

### The create/edit event type admin page.

### The scheduled events admin page.

</a>

In the next part of the series, we will jump into the action by creating a new Phoenix project and generating the necessary Ecto schemas for modeling both event types and events. In the meantime, you can check the end result [here](https://calendlex.herokuapp.com/), or have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/bigardone/calendlex).

Happy coding!
